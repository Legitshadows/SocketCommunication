Just some socket communication work that i made for a class assignemnt, probably wont update much depending on our teacher.
More assignemnts using this = more updates to the code.
If not, it will be left to be discontinued.

IP is set to localhost and port is 3490 (You can change to your own ip and port).

Commands are as follows:

ls, mv, up, bye and echo, might add more soon.

this code has edge cases checks to avoid certain things from breaking the console like enter or mis inputs.

Will probs add screenshots soon.
